This repository contains a comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline tailored for sentiment analysis datasets. Leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn, the project includes functionalities to handle missing values, detect and cap outliers, normalize features, and visualize data distributions. With a focus on transforming raw sentiment data into a structured format ready for analysis, the pipeline not only improves data quality but also enhances the accuracy of sentiment classification models. The final output is a cleaned dataset saved in CSV format, making it ready for further analysis or machine learning applications.
